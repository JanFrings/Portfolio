    <h3>The following article is a data scientific approach to evaluate the importance of the NFL draft for quarterbacks entering the league</h3>

    <br>
    <h3>Collecting data:</h3>
    </div>

    <p class='data-analysis'>
      Data analyses start with a set of data.<br>
      To make a choice of which kind of data to collect I looked at various factors:<br>
      <br>
      • The period of time to investigate<br>
      • The kind and the amount of data <br>
      • Which Quarterbacks to look at and what kind of stats to collect<br>
      • How to define a successful Quarterback<br>
      <br>
      The time period had to represent the near past and present.
      But also be long enough to cover the process long time professionals are going through in the league.
      I chose the turn of the millennium as the starting point.
      To reduce the amount of data I decided to compare successful Quarterbacks with one another, rather than all players that have been drafted since then.
      I  came to the conclusion that there was not only one indicator of success but a variety.<br>
      <br>
      Divided into two main groups:<br>
      • Quarterback related stats <br>
      • Team achievements (Postseasons & Super Bowl attempts).<br>
      <br>
      This left me with the conditions to scrape data from draft classes 2000 ongoing, of players that have started one or more postseason games.<br>
      Regarding the Quarterback stats I mainly looked at the factors used to calculate the NFL passer rating:<br>
      <br>
      • Pass attempts <br>
      • Pass completions <br>
      • Passing yards <br>
      • Passing touchdowns <br>
      • Passing interceptions <br>
      <br>
      Additional: <br>
      <br>
      • Games attended as starting Quarterback <br>
      • Draft round <br>

    <h2 class="container">Drawing insights:</h2>

    <p class='data-analysis'>
      The collected data had now to be explored.<br>
      I used various methods to gain insights and search for visible
      patterns to make generalized predictions beyond the sample set.<br>
      <br>
      Starting off with a statistical overview to get familiar with the data:
    </p>


    <td> <img class="data-horizontal" src="/static/nfl/stat_overview_1.png" alt=""> </td>
    <p class='data-analysis'>
      Strikingly the 50% and 75% quantile values stand out. It reveals that the majority of the Quarterbacks
      which made the criteria are actually first round picks and that only 25% were drafted later than round 4.
    </p>

    <table>
      <td>
        <p class='data-analysis-table'>
          Looking at the distribution we see how the first round picks outweigh the list of postseason attendant
          Quarterbacks and surprisingly the draft rounds 2 - 8(UDFA) don't show a decreasing frequency as may be expected.
          In fact, the draft rounds 2, 6 and undrafted Quarterbacks make up the same amount and the rest is close behind.
        </p>
      </td>
      <td> <img class="data-vertical-table" src="/static/nfl/draft_skewness_1.png" alt=""> </td>
    </table>

    <table class="freq-table">
      <td><img class="data-image-m" src="/static/nfl/freq_dist.png" alt=""></td>
      <td><img class="data-image-m" src="/static/nfl/bullet_diag.png" alt=""></td>
    </table>

    <p class='data-analysis'>
      At this point, the question occurs if the players drafted in the first round differ from later picks.
      Therefore we take a closer look at the stats each player achieved within the first 3 years after the draft.<br>
      <br>
      These heat maps show the correlation between the Quarterback stats, the correlation coefficient indicates dependencies and is
      scalable from 1.0(perfect positive correlation) over 0.0(no correlation) to -1.0(perfect negative correlation).
    </p>

    <table>
      <td> 1. Year<img class="data-image" src="/static/nfl/corr_1.png" alt=""></td>
      <td> 2. Year<img class="data-image" src="/static/nfl/corr_2.png" alt=""></td>
      <td> 3. Year<img class="data-image" src="/static/nfl/corr_3.png" alt=""></td>
    </table>

    <p class="data-analysis">
      We can see an outstanding positive correlation in between almost all stats. This allows the assumption
      that Quarterbacks, that make it into the league are going to average a predictable ratio of completions,
      yards, touchdowns, and even interceptions given the proportionate amount of attempts.<br>
      Furthermore, the negative correlation of the draft round to the other stats illustrates that a smaller (earlier)
      draft round goes along with increased Qb related stats.<br>
      The insights we gained through the correlation heat maps emphasize that the stats are highly based on the number
      of attempts and that this deserves differentiation in more detail.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The following statistical overview shows the ratio of completions, yards, touchdowns, and interceptions in relation
      to the number of attempts:
    </p>

    <table>
      <td> <img class="data-horizontal" src="/static/nfl/stat_per_att_overview_1.png" alt=""> </td>
    </table>

    <p class="data-analysis">
      Examining the chart, especially the extreme values catch the eye.
      Values like these are notably unrealistic and to get a better understanding of how these values fit into the bigger
      picture a boxplot comes in handy.
    </p>

    <table>
      <td> <img class="data-horizontal" src="/static/nfl/outliers_1.png" alt=""> </td>
    </table>

    <p class="data-analysis">
      The extrema we observed prior are now visible as outliers.<br>
      Exceptional values like these are the result of a very small number of attempts which either went better than average or
      below average but have no statistical usability.<br>
      Further investigations are made without the outlying values that were based on an unrepresentative number of attempts.
      This ensures more accurate predictions.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      The following collection of scatter plots displays the completion-, yard-, touchdown- and interception-ratio within a three
      year time period with a black line indicating the mean value.

    <p class="data-analysis">
      The primal observation at this point is that the Quarterbacks drafted early on,
      not necessarily differ a lot in their yields. In fact, there is no conclusive evidence
      that the first round Quarterbacks clearly stand out from others.<br>
      However, the sheer number of first rounders is strikingly visible again.<br>
      The ability to produce consistent results is crucial to enter the league and is even more important once drafted,
      to be considered as a starting player.
      To put some numbers on, these are the ratios the Quarterbacks who attendant a postseason averaged in their first three years:
    </p>
        <table class="freq-table">
          <tr>
            <td class="stat-table">• Completions</td>
            <td class="stat-table">  ≈   60 %</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="stat-table">• Yards</td>
            <td class="stat-table">  ≈  7.0 / Attempt</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="stat-table">• Touchdowns</td>
            <td class="stat-table">  ≈   3.85%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="stat-table">• Interceptions</td>
            <td class="stat-table">  ≈   3.0%</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
    <p class="data-analysis">

      Concluding there is another factor for a Franchise to draft Quarterbacks early rather than significant
      performance differences.
      When considering to draft a Quarterback initially in the draft, this goes along with the
      potential upside an outstanding new leader could have on the team.
      Moreover, first round picks, in general, are expected to be able to make a difference right
      away which then leads to more experience early on in their career.
      Over time the consequence of this process is that the more experienced players can produce constant
      results and are able to compete on bigger stages like the postseason or the super bowl.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Looking at the number of games the Quarterbacks get to start, shows a clear differential favoring
      the players being drafted early.

    <p class="data-analysis">
      Draft rounds play a major role when it comes to gaining enough experience as a starter and ultimatly to execute well under pressure on a big stage.
      This doen't make it easier for first round picks to compete in the NFL but it's more likely that they'll be able to shows
      and grow there skills.<br>
      Conclusion:<br>
      The earlier the draft round the better the chances are to get to work right away. <br>
      The later the draft round the more important it is to deliver whenever the opportunity occures.<br>
